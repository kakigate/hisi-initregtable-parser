/* Analysis of typical start of init register table */

MISC     - 0x0c8  - ADCL power on.
SYS CTRC - 0x0    - Change from "DOZE" to "SLOW" mode
SYS CTRL - 0x0    - (READ) from status that "SLOW" mode is in use

/* By this Point "SLOW" mode is in use */

CRG      - 0x0000 - APLL
CRG      - 0x0004 - APLL
CRG      - 0x0030 - SoC Clock
CRG      - 0x00e8 - (READ) CRG status register
CRG      - 0x00c0 - SFC clock
SYS CTRL - 0x014  - PLLCTRL

/* PLL configurations done */

SYS CTRL - 0x000  - Change from "SLOW" to "NORMAL"
SYS CTRL - 0x000  - (READ) from status that "NORMAL" mode is in use

/* By this point clock system has been configured and core is at full speed */

SYS CTRL - 0x090  - DDRT0 training register
SYS CTRL - 0x15c  - Sysboot11 ... Shadow register to store something? Initialization flags? Configuration? Clock configuration?
SYS CTRL - 0x15c  - Sysboot11 ...   Note: Sysboot11 is not referred to from bootloader code
SYS CTRL - 0x15c  - Sysboot11 ...     Datasheet says nothing much
SYS CTRL - 0x15c  - Sysboot11 ...       Your guess..
MISC     - 0x014  - Set PWM 0-3 as output of PMC module.

/* Multiple(dozens) operations to these registers in varying order will follow to configure external ram */

DDRC0
PMC

/* Also operations to registers usually follow */

IOMUX
GPIO-X

/* One or more full null entrys must trail register operations in order to terminate iteration */


/* By return of init_registers ddr mem range is considered enabled */
